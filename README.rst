Instructions 1 (CMD):

    - download or clone this repo

    - if download file is zipped/archived, extract it

    - open a cmd, in windows press windows+r then type ``cmd``

    - run ``python`` or ``python3`` depending on your setup

    - make sure that the version of the python running is version 3

    - run:
        ``from exercise05 import *``

    - run your activity script:
        + Longest Word run:
            ``longest_word()``

        + Canonical Prime Factorization:
            ``canonical_prime_factorization()``

        + Polynomial Addition:
            ``polinomial_addition()``

        + Finite Continued Fractions:
            ``finite_continued_fractions()``

        + Histogram:
            ``histogram()``
